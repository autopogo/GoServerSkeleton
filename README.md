# Go Server Skeleton
A skeleton for making website servers in Go

## Usage
Build and run server with:  
    `make && ./run`  
(you may need sudo access for ./run, depending on your ports)

## Versioning
Tags are used for versioning, to tag new version use:  
    `git tag -a <version>`  
[HINT: Use `git tag -l` to see past versions for reference]

If ever pushing with new tags, remember to:  
    `git push <remote> --tags`

To pull any new tags to local, use:  
    `git pull <remote>`
